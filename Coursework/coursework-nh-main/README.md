# F28PL Coursework

This is the repository with the stubs of the implementation for the
coursework for F28PL. In order to submit the coursework, you will need
to *fork* this repository, creating your own, private version on
GitLab, clone your fork onto your local machine, create your solution
within your repository and push the solutions to your own fork of the
project. 

## Getting started

The first steps to get you to the point of being able to create your
own solution are as follows:

1. Fork the project. To do this, find the "Fork" button in the
   top-right of the project's web-page, click it, and follow the
   instructions. Remember to set your fork as private (your lecturers
   will automatically be added to your project, so you do not need to
   worry about their access).

2. Clone your fork to create an image of the repository on your local
   machine, attached to your fork. To do this, you will need a working
   `git` installation. (Note: if you're developing the coursework
   under WSL, your working `git` installation should also be on
   WSL. You should be able to get `git` working on your Linux
   subsystem using something like `sudo apt-get install git`.)

3. Develop your coursework. At this point, you can start developing
   your coursework. To avoid data loss, it is wise to periodically
   *commit* your changes to your local repository, and *push* them to
   your fork. (This will also allow you to work across multiple
   machines.)

4. Remember to push your solution to the coursework problems to
   your fork of the project *before the deadline*!

## Developing your project

Once you clone the repository, you will notice this `README` and a
`src/` directory. This is where the solution files live, and that is
where you should keep them. The source files are called
`question1.ml`, `question2.ml`, and `question3.ml` respectively, and
provide templates for the solution to each question. The files are
self-contained, so you should be able to work on the solutions using
an editor and an evaluator, as usual. Make sure to provide both the
implementation and explanations that detail how your code should work,
and why you designed it the way you did, as well as answers to
questions that do not require coding.
